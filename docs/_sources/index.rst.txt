Introduction
============

A repository of small python functions to reduce day to day overhead. A lot of functionality that we rewrite almost daily still requires searching in an old repository to view how you wrote that one function. This repository is meant to make that a thing of the past by providing standard functions and snippets commonly used.

.. note:: These functions are mainly written for myself and my own workflow. But if you find usefull things, help yourself! I might eventually make this into an actual package.

.. warning:: I'm still very much experimenting with packaging and documenting using python poetry and sphinx, respectively. Your experience may therefore differ from mine ;)
